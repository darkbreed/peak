The bank holiday weekend is nearly upon us, we have all our camping gear sorted and are booked into our campsite. The only thing to do now is to decided on a route for Sunday and which of the 100 fells we will tick off our list. As usual, I have found a technical solution to this and have signed up with Viewranger and I have to say despite the site looking a little dated, the service and apps are very good.

Viewranger lets you record tracks as you are walking or create routes to follow and  then share or sell them via your account on their website so other users can then download your routes to their smartphones or GPS devices. Its a nice idea, a kind of crowd sourced directory of walking and hiking routes with a bit of social networking thrown in. And don’t worry if you don’t have the latest and greatest smart device, their apps are available on old Symbian devices too and the routes are available in generic formats that can be loaded into most decent GPS devices (think Garmins etc).

The service also lets you choose from a multitude of map types including Ordinance Survey, which you can buy by the tile as and when you need them. For example, I singed up and bought a £5.99 pack of credits which gave me 400 credits, I then used my credits to buy the map tiles I needed for this weekend. I think each tile is about 5 credits and covers a ~6 mile squared area.

### Dove Crag, Hart Crag and Fairfield via Dovedale

We really wanted to do a route that starts directly from our campsite so there is no driving involved before and after a long day in the hills and the site we are staying on is perfect for this. We are booked into Sykeside next to Brotherswater which is just up from Ambleside over the Kirkstone Pass and is the perfect place to stay if you are going to venture up Fairfield, Red Screes, Hart Crag etc. It’s also only a stones throw from Patterdale, Glenridding and Ambleside so supplies of food and gear are all within reach. Also there is a fantastic pub on site, The Brotherswater Inn.

This route starts from a footpath to the rear of the site and heads almost straight up through Dovedale to Dove Crag. Once we are up here Hart Crag and Fairfield should be easy enough to tick off the list although I think the initial ascent will be a killer.

### Helvellyn and Striding Edge

Once we have reached the summit of Fairfield I think we will have decision to make. Depending on how we feel (bearing in mind this is the first walk of this nature myself and Julie have done is quite some time) we either push on and take on Helvellyn and make our way back down to Patterdale via Striding Edge or we backtrack and descend back into Sykeside via Little Hart Crag. This route would only be about 8 miles as opposed to the 13.2 miles by including Helvellyn. On the flat both distances are no problem, but the ascent and descent in this route is going to take it out of us I think.

For now though the plan is do to the whole route including Helvellyn. I will post again after the walk, probably from the comfort of the Brotherswater Inn, and let you know how it went.
