Let’s get one thing out of the way: I love a good gadget and I spend too much money on them. So as you can imagine my rucksack will be filled with more that just a few sarnies, a fleece and a waterproof to escape the inevitable English rain. The desire to get out in the hill is as much to do with the desire to some of this tech to its potential as it is to get fit and healthy again.

I will be taking some serious kit into the hills to track and capture our progress, health data and to capture the stunning scenery around us. I’ll be capturing our hikes on two (possibly three) cameras: a Canon 70D, 1100D and a GoPro Hero. In fact the GoPro is one of the reasons I decided I wanted to get back out walking again. I bought one without really needing it and thought “well, what do I do iwth this now?”. In a weeks time I am shooting a wedding video. In fact I bought a new camera in order to shoot said wedding because of its superior video capabilities and I thought that the GoPro woudl be a good addition to the kit for the day

But the thing is, once the wedding is out of the way I probably won’t have many opportunities to make any films. There are after all only so many videos of my cat that I can make and I do not see myself becoming a professional wedding videographer any time soon. So I figure I either become a vlogger, make unboxing videos and spend all my free time arguing with kids on Youtube, or get out and find something worth filming. And the Lakeland fells are definitely worth filming.

I’ve put together a list of all the stuff I will be taking on these hikes, it may seem a lot (in fact its way more than the sandwich box and survival bag that I used to carry) but ultimately this sttuff is to be used and if I want to capture Lakeland at its finest then it has to come with me. So the first thing I needed was a bag that was up to the job, and this is the one I went for….

### The Lowepro Photo Sport 30L

This bag is awesome. I know it may be a little sad to get too excited about a rucksack, but this thing really is awesome and I havent even taken it on its maiden voyage yet.

The choices are surprisngly limited for DSLR friendly hiking rucksacks. DSLR bags always tend to fall into two camps: the urban commuter and the dedicated camera bag. Commuter type bags offer a decent amount of space and protection for cameras, lenses and a tablet / laptop but they are not much use for anything else you may need like lunch or a water bottle. The dedicated camera bags are designed for professional photograhpers who carry nothing but camera kit. Neither of these are much cop for hiking. You either have to pack your camera and nothing else or you have to wedge your other belongings in and around your camera kit. In fact I did this on a recent trip to Vienna which only really ended up in some busted seams and a compromise on both clothing and camera gear.

As I was planning this first hike, I dug out my old rucksack (which is still in pretty good shape). Its a sturday rucksack, about 25 litres with a rain cover etc. But I really wanted something that would protect my gear a little better and also give me access to the camera without too much fuss. I mean the last thing I want to do is lug around 2 kilos of camera and nto use it because its burried and all wrapped up at the bottom of my bag. So after much reading around I decided I would have to go Lowepro again, expensive I know but I have never bougth a bad piece of kit from them. You really do get what you pay for in this market.

The Photo Sport 30L AW is superb, and I havent event taken it out yet. I read around and was tempted initially by the PhotoSport II range but was put off by the capacity once the camera was taken into consideration. 20 litres just didnt seem enough. I then looked at the PhotoSport 300 AW which was slightly bigger and was all set to swallow hard and hand over the £150 but decided to take a quick look on eBay first.

it was here I found the Lowepro 30L AW which I believe is the forerunner of the 300 AW,, but I could be mistaken. Despite not being the latest and greatest, it seemed to fit the bill. It looked like a proper hiking rucksack with added camera support and as luck would have it there was a fellow Bristolian seller on eBay with one up for grabs at about half the price of a 300 AW so it was a no brainer. God bless eBay.

The camera section of this bag is cavernous. In my initial tests it has swallowed up my 70D with a Sigma 18-250mm walk around lens attached, plus a Sigma 10-22mm lens, spare batteries lens filters, cables, SD cards and mobile battery charger with room to spare for a GoPro Hero. With all that safely tucked up in the cinch pouch, this bag still offers a good 30L of space for all the things you would need for a day in the hills like extra layers, waterproofs, food, first aid kits etc. The camera compartment is accessible via a side entry flap so that you can swing your bag around and access the camera easily without it being burried under layers of waterproofs and fleeces.

There is also support for a hydration system although it does not have a dedicated pocket for the bladder as some reviews have stated (unless I have just competely missed it, which is entirely possible) and plenty of pockets and lash points for trekking poles, tripods, sit mats etc. The waist and chest straps are very comfortable and keep the weight evenly distributed on your back. And as you would expect from a bag of this type it also has a full built in rain cover.

I should point out that I have not tried this bag with a battery grip or a mega long telephoto lens (mainly due to the cost of owning one one these!) and I have read a few reviews saying that they thought the camera compartment was a little small if you are using a full frame DSLR with battery grip so YMMV. This bag is made for hiking and taking with you as much kit as you need for the hike and will allow you to bring a modest amount of DSLR kit. If you are only out in the hills for photography, you may wish to consider something different for your kit.

For me though it’s perfect for a day in the hills and I genuinely can’t wait to take this bag out.
