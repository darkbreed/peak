A bit late in posting this but our weekend in the Lakes went well, although the route was not quit the route we had planned. Still, the weather (almost) held out for us and it was a good first attempt.

As it was a bank holiday weekend we decided to leave Bristol at about 4am to avoid the usual motorway hell. The plan worked and we felt quite smug as we rolled into Ambleside and up the Kirkstone Pass listening to radio reports of queues, accidents and general traffic chaos. I am amazed it doesn’t occur to more people to get up early and beat the traffic but to be honest I am quite glad they don’t. We pitched camp at Sykeside Campsite on Brothers Water. A lovely site with a great pub attached to it (as I have no doubt mentioned in previous posts). Tent was set up by 10:30 and we were busy spending a small fortune in Ambleside and Keswick by lunchtime.

We spent the evening in the Brothers Water Inn checking the maps and decided to adjust our ambitious route a little to not take in Helvellyn. I have climbed it several times but never from the direction we were going to approach it from that and Helvellyn on a bank holiday weekend is like the M6, you would not be able to move for people on the top and that was the reason for choosing Fairfield in the first place. Also we were a little unsure as to our fitness levels and although 13 miles is a totally manageable distance, we had not really taken into account the terrain, easy to do when you are just looking at maps so we decided to just attack Hart Crag and Dove Crag this time around. We also thought that we could maybe attempt Red Screes as well but decided to play it by ear and see how we felt once we were up there.

Unfortunately the weather turned a bit on Saturday evening into Sunday. We had torrential rain through the night on Saturday (tent held up very well!) and woke on Sunday to a murky, misty grey morning and we couldn’t even see the hills we were going to climb. Still, it had stopped raining and it was pretty mild so it wasn’t too bad.

We managed to summit Hart Crag (after nearly missing it due to a wrong turn) and Dove Crag (after nearly missing it due to mist). We felt quite good and I was impressed with my own fitness. I wasn’t sure how I would be doing after only 3 months of treadmill running but I actually felt really good and like I used to when I was doing this 15 years ago. Julie was suffering a little but had managed the ascent and once we were at the top and were walking between the ridges we were feeling quite good. We took a couple of wrong turns but these only set us back a few minutes in the grand scheme of things, this was mainly due to visibility and the fact that we could only see about 20ft in front of us at any one time. The weather did break a little on the way down and we managed to get a glimpse of the scenery we were missing out on, but it soon closed in again and we were back to the mist and low cloud. You can see our actual route below:

### Hart Crag and Dove Crag route from Sykeside
Our plan was to summit Red Screes after Dove Crag and then make our way down a very steep ascent to the Kirkstone Pass Inn for a break and then maybe head up the peaks behind it and follow the path back down to the campsite while avoiding the road. However we had to cut this a bit short as it became clear on the descent from Dove Crag to Scandale pass that Julie was struggling with a pain in her toe. This slowed us down a bit and we decided to just head back down to the Campsite via Scandale. We had already been out for 5 and a bit hours and figured that the descent through Scandale was probably another couple of hours so was probably the best option.

The descent was slow and awkward, the path wasn’t great and the previous nights rain had made the ground pretty sodden under foot. I actually sunk a foot into a peaty puddle up to the ankle at one point, good ol’ Goretex on the new boots kept me dry. After about an and hour and a bit of descent it levelled out and we headed back to the campsite and a well deserved pint in the Barn End Bar at the Campsite.

All in all it was a good first effort at getting back in the game and even though we didn’t managed quite the number of peaks we wanted to, we still knocked off 2 and got a 8 and a bit mile hike in and actually did it reasonably easily. No knee pains, I still felt like I could do more after I got back down and we both felt like we wanted to do it again. We did however, decide that we should probably do a few more practice routes before coming back and doing more of the one hundred. Julie struggled with the descents so we need to do some shorter walks and some walks with some less challenging descents to get her used to it.

We will probably still do some of these up in the Lakes, some fells like Catbells are much more straight forward but you are still rewarded with a good walk and some amazing scenery if you get the right day.

Lakeland, as usual you have been awesome. We will be back!
