So I finally caved and bought a drone. I have absolutely no need for one, but I have always wanted one. Not for the fun of flying, but purely for the photographic and vidoegraphic opportunities it opens up. 

DJI have always been the gold standard in camera drones, and I always fancied a Phantom or a Mavic. They are not cheap but the quality is no doubt worth the money if you ere slightly more than a hobbyist. And while the Mavic is portable-ish, its still a bit bigger than I would have liked and the drones in the Phantom range a hulking, white, plastic beasts that really you would only have if you were a film maker, or had a project in mind.  

Enter the Spark, or rather enter the Mavic Air that made the Spark more affordable. Once the Mavic Air was released, there was a slew of Sparks available on eBay for ~Â£300. I could just about justify this to myself (and my wife) as an impulse buy, so I bought one and I have recently been on my first trip to somewhere both worth filming, and with enought space that I didn't immediately plough it into a tree... or somebodies face!

I have to say I am very, very impressed with the Spark. The fact that you can now have a pretty much broadcast-quality (ok, it's not 4K but its a very crisp 1080p) camera drone that you can sling in your rucksack when you head into the hills is, I think, remarkable. It's no bigger or heavier than my sandwich box and that takes into accound the case, 2 batteries and spare proppellers. I won't go into an in-depth review of the Spark here, there are plenty of reviews, videos, unboxings (if you are tragic enough to enjoy those!) etc. elsewhere online but I will share some initial footage taken with my Spark here. 

We recently went on a bit of a road trip around the west coast of Scotland and The Lake District in our camper, and I took the Spark along for the ride. I'm still learning to fly it so the footage is not as cinematic as I would maybe have liked, but I'll get there.

What I love about the Spark is that suddenly I can add dolly, crane and all kinds of other cinematic style shots to my videos all from a device that as I previously stated, fits in my rucksack alongside my waterproofs and my sandwiches. You can go from your bag to in the air in a couple of minutes, get your shots and move on. The 16 minute battery life is plenty as long as you know what shots you want to get before you head out. This is the bit I need to get better at, and I may need to start storyboarding rather than just randomly shootinh and hoping for the best, but I am still learning and will hopefully get a bit better over the coming months in terms of both the quality of the shots, and in my control of the drone. 

Actually, I have to. I have another wedding video to do in September and I don't think the bride would take to kindly to a runaway Spark!
