After years of being overweight and unfit, I have decided to go back to doing what I used to love, hiking. Ok so I didn’t enjoy every aspect of it, the early starts were never my thing when I was younger but between the ages of about 15 and 19 my dad and I covered a lot of ground in UK national parks, scaling all of the countries highest peaks multiple times over.

I used to really enjoy it when I was out there but then life got in the way, and I started working part time on the weekends while at college, then came University, pubs and gigs (ok, so I did that at college too) and then a career in software development began. In between all this I met my lovely wife and we bought a flat (and a cat), then a few years later a house and before you know it we are 32; 13 years have passed and the biggest hill I have been up in that time is probably the path back home from Beeses Tea Gardens. Actually thats not true, we did climb Cadair Idris a few years back but you get the idea, I am out of shape.

###Why are we doing this?

There are a few driving forces behind this. For one, we love travelling and I love photography so it’s a good excuse to get out and take photos and justify all of the expensive gear I have acquired, another reason is to get fit and get back to doing what we enjoy. But there is a third reason, Julie and I have been going through consultations for fertility treatment over the last year and a couple of things have come out of it, but needless to say my weight and fitness were topics of discussion and I was told I needed to do something about it. It’s the biggest incentive I have had (and probably will ever have) to start eating better, cut down on the drinking and get fit again.

At my heaviest a couple of years ago I topped the scales at 18st 4lb, which is far from ideal. In my late teens I was 10st something and in fact when we went to our GP at the beginning of our consultations and she weighed me, she was quite surprised to see that last time I had been to the doctors when I was 16 (I don’t go very often!) I was considered anorexic on the BMI scale and now I was clinically obese! It was a bit of a wake up call and I was told I had to lose weight before they could even refer us. I was a blocker to the treatment so I had to do something about it.

The first round of consultations went ok, I hit my target weight but then stalled again and the weight crept back up over the festive season and then at our next round of appointments the subject reared its head again so I decided to do something a bit more drastic: I took up running. Now, I hate running and always have but I hate it less than cycling and going for a hike 3 times a week is just not practical. Luckily our neighbour had a treadmill that was gathering dust in his garage so he kindly donated it to me and I started on a couch to 5k program. I also went and spent silly money on an Apple watch to track my progress figured all of the beer vouchers I wouldn’t be spending may as well go to good use. I have now just completed the 5k program in just over 10 weeks and have managed to shift over a stone and a half in weight by doing this and cutting out alcohol completely midweek. To be honest I have cut down massively on weekends too. No more Keith Floyd style cooking sessions for me, well for now at least.

###The Lakeland one hundred

Ten weeks on from the decision to get fit, I have just started on the 10k program but I really want to get back up in the hills again, for a good few reasons. Firstly I prefer it to running, although I will still keep it up as its more practical for midweek training. Secondly, it’s really pretty out there. We have some amazing countryside and having spent the best part of a grand on camera kit this year alone I really should get out and capture it so a couple of weeks ago Julie and I decided to get back up to the Lake District for a couple of days and head for the hills again. Julie hasn’t really done as much of this as I used to do, but the few walks we have done she has enjoyed and she wants to get back out as much as I do.

This weekend while raiding my dads stash of camping gear, the subject of the Lakeland 100 came up. For those of you who don’t know, the Lakeland 100 is a list of the 100 highest fells in the Lakes not to be confused with the slightly mental Lakeland 100 Ultra marathon, we are way off being able to do that! And we thought yeh, why not. I have already ticked off at least 10 of these over the years but we are starting the count from 0 and will attempt them all as a couple.

So it starts here. Well, Sunday August 28th to be precise when we head out to do the first few fells on the list. This blog will chart our progress and the challenge will give us something to focus on while we attempt to start a family. Who knows, we may not complete the list as quickly as we would like and that would be ok by us, but until then we will use the time we have to tick off as many as possible.
